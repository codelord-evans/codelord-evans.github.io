#### `The #1 Online MarketPlace for Shopping for Outfits`
 {{< lead >}} For years middle and lower class Kenyans have been exploited by hungry brokers when buying secondhand clothes. It does not have to be that way because a new way to shop is here. {{< /lead >}}
 
I am building the #1 online marketplace for you  to shop for outfits.

  With `AR` you will be ale to try on outfits from the cormfort of your sofa seat. 
 `Secure P2P payments` to make sure you do not lose your hard earned money to scammers.
  A `pricing system` to make sure that products are not overpriced, and many more other features.

If you would be the first one to try out these features join my [waitlist](http://localhost:1313/projects/).
